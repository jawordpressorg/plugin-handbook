# Suggesting text for the site privacy policy

Every plugin that collects, uses, or stores user data, or passes it to an external source or third party, should add a section of suggested text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with `wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )`. This will allow site administrators to pull that information into their siteâ€™s privacy policy.

To make this simpler for the users, the text should address the questions provided in the default privacy policy:

*   What personal data we collect and why we collect it
    *   Their own manually input information
    *   WP: Contact forms
    *   WP: Comments
    *   WP: Cookies
    *   WP: Third party embeds
    *   Analytics
*   Who we share your data with
*   How long we retain your data
*   What rights you have over your data
*   Where we send your data
*   Your contact information
*   How we protect your data
*   What data breach procedures we have in place
*   What third parties we receive data from
*   What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data
*   Any industry regulatory disclosure requirements

While not all of these questions will be applicable to all plugins, we recommend taking care with the sections on data sharing.

## Code Example

Note: It is recommended to call wp\_add\_privacy\_policy\_content during the admin\_init action. Calling it outside of an action hook can lead to problems, see ticket #44142 for details.

Note: Supplemental information can be provided through the use of the specialized `.privacy-policy-tutorial` CSS class. Any content contained within HTML elements that have this CSS class applied will be omitted from the clipboard when the section content is copied.
