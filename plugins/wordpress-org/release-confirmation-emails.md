# Release Confirmation Emails

This feature is currently experimental.

In order to better protect plugins from inadvertent releases, weâ€™ve added a new **opt-in** feature for plugins: Release Confirmation.

When enabled on a plugin, all users with commit access will be emailed when there is a new release ready. One of them will need to click on the link to approve the release.

## Requirements
